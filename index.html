			 <h4>I was born in Belgrade </h4>
			 <p>
				Belgrade is colorful in the sun, gray in the rain, incredibly lively and surrounded by the Sava and Danube rivers. The lively interface between Orient and Occident is 2000 years old, has been destroyed 40 times and like a phoenix rose again and again from the ashes. Cultural life can compete with that of Berlin: whether exhibitions, concerts or literary events - something is always happening in the Balkan metropolis. And Belgrade is also Zemun, the city on the Danube, which was once a border town between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire and is now a district of Belgrade.</p>
		 </div>

		 <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
			<h4>My Personality and Character</h4>
			<p>Curious and energetic, I am the greatest traveler among men. My philosophical view of an open mind motivates others to wander far and wide in search of the meaning of life. As someone who is extroverted, optimistic and enthusiastic, it is difficult to keep me on the ground. I love change, in fact change is essential to feel good. </p>
		</div>

		 <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
			 <h4>Based in Berlin</h4>
			 <p>Berlin is a gathering of everything and everyone, a city of beautiful and pleasant people, a city of art, a city that lives and breathes with all its visitors. Rich history, cultural and historical monuments, museums-bars, pubs, pubs, squats, graffiti, abandoned art colonies, chambers, bunkers and shelters from the Second World Warâ€¦ Famous sights to visit are the Berlin Wall, Siegesseule, Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, Alexanderplatz , street Unter den Linden. Welcome! </p>

		<h3>Hi, I'm Suzana, and I am looking for a remote job as a Web Developer.

			For over a year I've been learning software development in the Digital Career Institute, Berlin. So far, I've completed my one-year training as a Full Stack Web Developer, and I've attended a two-month internship in Berlin.
			At the end of my one-year training, I presented a final project called "Discofy Music App" (which you can check out here //the link to be attached to the word 'here'). I worked alongside one colleague on this project, and we had six weeks to complete it. It included project planning, coding and presentation preparation. The coding itself took 3 weeks.
			
			I've always been interested in software development and I feel thrilled to have finally been able to learn and work in this field this past year. I'm excited by the many different opportunities and choices that this career provides. I'm most attracted to the idea of being able to consistently learn and grow, both as a developer and a person, and continually refine my grasp of the present and up-and-coming technologies. I would like to be given the opportunity to show who I am as a person - hard-working, positive and cooperative.
			
			Career-wise, front-end development is what interests me the most, although back-end development is something that I'm skilled in as well.
			
			I'm looking forward to your feedback and hope to get hired soon.
			
			Stay healthy,
			
			S.J.</h3>

					 <p>I love the smells, tastes, sounds, sights and feelings of a place - new or familiar. I think my memories are closely interwoven with the scent of an event or a period of time so being able to catalogue a place by smell helps me remember the feeling of being there...</p>
