			 <h4>I was born in Belgrade </h4>
			 <p>
				Belgrade is colorful in the sun, gray in the rain, incredibly lively and surrounded by the Sava and Danube rivers. The lively interface between Orient and Occident is 2000 years old, has been destroyed 40 times and like a phoenix rose again and again from the ashes. Cultural life can compete with that of Berlin: whether exhibitions, concerts or literary events - something is always happening in the Balkan metropolis. And Belgrade is also Zemun, the city on the Danube, which was once a border town between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire and is now a district of Belgrade.</p>

			<h4>My Personality and Character</h4>
			<p>Curious and energetic, I am the greatest traveler among men. My philosophical view of an open mind motivates others to wander far and wide in search of the meaning of life. As someone who is extroverted, optimistic and enthusiastic, it is difficult to keep me on the ground. I love change, in fact change is essential to feel good. </p>
		</div>

		 <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
			 <h4>Based in Berlin</h4>
			 <p>Berlin is a gathering of everything and everyone, a city of beautiful and pleasant people, a city of art, a city that lives and breathes with all its visitors. Rich history, cultural and historical monuments, museums-bars, pubs, pubs, squats, graffiti, abandoned art colonies, chambers, bunkers and shelters from the Second World Warâ€¦ Famous sights to visit are the Berlin Wall, Siegesseule, Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, Alexanderplatz , street Unter den Linden. Welcome! </p>

		<h5 class="text-center">Junior Full Stack Web Developer</h5>
		<h3>I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer with 1+ years of experience in project development. My goal is to create creative websites that are also technologically up-to-date. In order to achieve optimal results. My interest is largely in line with the qualifications required for the position in the Creative Web Design agency. I am currently still in further training, which I will complete at the end of May. So I can start a job from the end of May/beginning of June. It is important to me that I can be hired remotely, so I applied throughout Deutschland.In my 1+year training as a full stack web developer at DCI, I have developed a lot of websites in Front and Backend. In addition to learning the latest technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as well as various frameworks such as Bootstrap, React and jQuery, working on practical projects is an integral part of the training. We have been working with Database MongoDB for a very long time.</h3>

					 <h4>Travel with me</h4>
					 <p>I love the smells, tastes, sounds, sights and feelings of a place - new or familiar. I think my memories are closely interwoven with the scent of an event or a period of time so being able to catalogue a place by smell helps me remember the feeling of being there. Also food. Hooray for all the food and recipes that have been passed through generations, families and communities. I also love the feeling that I am somewhere removed from my everyday experience. It is exciting and relieving all at the same time. I love that traveling is not just one thing. Traveling can be fun. It can be invigorating, enlightening, powerful, relaxing, overwhelming, emotional or even a struggle..</p>

					<h4>How meditation help me</h4>
					<p>Mindfulness allows you to have better relationships and also creates a work-life balance. Meditation allows you to live in the moment. This allows to leave your office stress at the office and enjoy time spent with your family. Your mind gets trained to shift from office to home and vice-versa.</p>
